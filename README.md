# LOAN APPROVAL DATASET

Develop a machine learning model to predict whether a loan application should be approved or denied based on historical data.

Dataset is a classification model,The model will classify loan applications into two categories: approved or denied.The model should output a probability score for approval and a final classification (approved/denied).


## Data Description

Columns

1.Loan_ID: Unique identifier for each loan application.

2.Gender: Gender of the applicant (e.g., Male, Female).

3.Married: Marital status of the applicant (e.g., Yes, No).

4.Dependents: Number of dependents (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3+).

5.Education: Education level of the applicant (e.g., Graduate, Not Graduate).

6.Self_Employed: Indicates if the applicant is self-employed (e.g., Yes, No).

7.ApplicantIncome: Monthly income of the applicant (in currency units).

8.CoapplicantIncome: Monthly income of the co-applicant (in currency units).

9.LoanAmount: Loan amount requested (in currency units).

10.Loan_Amount_Term: Term of the loan (in months).

11.Credit_History: Credit history status (e.g., 1 for creditworthy, 0 for not creditworthy).

12.Property_Area: Area where the property is located (e.g., Urban, Semiurban, Rural).

13.Loan_Status: Loan approval status (e.g., Approved, Not Approved).
## Establish Metrics for Success

1.Accuracy: The proportion of correctly classified loan applications (both approvals and denials) out of the total applications.

2.Precision: The proportion of correctly approved loans out of all loans the model predicted as approved. High precision means fewer false positives.

3.Recall: The proportion of actual approved loans that the model correctly predicted. High recall means fewer false negatives.

4.F1 Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, useful when there is a trade-off between precision and recall.

5.Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC): Measures the model’s ability to distinguish between approved and denied loans.

6.Confusion Matrix: Provides detailed insights into true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
## Analysis and Modeling

1.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform EDA to understand the dataset’s characteristics and relationships between features.

2.Feature Selection: Identify and select relevant features for model training.

3.Model Training: Use machine learning algorithms to train models for predicting loan approval.

4.Model Evaluation: Assess model performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
